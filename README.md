### 👋 Hey, I’m Maycon

CPO & CTO building digital products, AI solutions and data-driven strategies that turn complex challenges into real, shipped value. Eternal developer. 

- 👀 I’m interested in the shortest path between **complex problem** and **elegant solution** – especially where **AI, product strategy and software engineering** meet. 
- 🧠 What I actually do: lead teams, design roadmaps, validate PMF, and use data to guide decisions (not decorate dashboards). 
- 🤖 Recently:  
  - Leading AI & ML verticals approved by **Nvidia** acceleration programs  
  - Scaling product delivery by **+320%** and growing core revenue metrics in ERP and B2B products 
- 💻 Roots I never lost: started as a **full-stack developer**, shipping code in Java, MEAN stack, React, Node.js and cloud architectures – that’s why every strategy I design has to survive production. 
- 🌱 I’m currently deepening my journey in **Data Science & Machine Learning (MBA – Harvard)** and experimenting with AI copilots to augment product and engineering workflows. 
- 💬 I love talking about:  
  **Product Discovery**, **AI in real businesses**, **data governance**, **systems thinking**, and how to break the “impossible” into small shippable possibles. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:  
  - AI-powered products (B2B / ERP / SaaS)  
  - Experiments that connect **business strategy + data + engineering**  
  - Open-source tools that make product teams more effective
